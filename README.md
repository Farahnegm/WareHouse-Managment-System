# ðŸ“¦ Warehouse Management System

## ðŸ“‹ Description
This project is developed to enhance and streamline warehouse management operations across the core interactions between suppliers, customers, and employees.
It handles all essential warehouse transactions, ensuring smooth inventory flow and permission-based access control.

The system manages the complete lifecycle of warehouse operations, including:

Supply Orders â€” Increasing stock items in the warehouse.

Release Orders â€” Decreasing stock items during customer deliveries.

Employee/Supplier Permissions â€” Restricting actions based on specific roles and authorizations.

Additionally, the application provides a set of user-friendly forms to make warehouse management efficient and accessible for all types of users.

The project architecture is built with a clean design using Windows Forms, adhering to best coding practices and offering a strong foundation for scalability and future expansion.

## ðŸš€ Why This Project?
To simulate and manage real-world warehouse operations with high accuracy.

To automate inventory tracking, ensuring stock quantities are updated correctly after every transaction.

To implement secure permission systems, giving employees and suppliers access only to authorized operations.

To practice advanced programming concepts like code-first database design, secure structure, and real-world modeling.

To strengthen skills in desktop application development using modern tools and technologies.

##ðŸ›  Technologies Used
C# â€” Core programming language for building business logic and application layers.

Windows Forms (WinForms) â€” Used for creating the desktop user interface.

Entity Framework (Code First Approach) â€” For database modeling, migrations, and seamless database management.

SQL Server â€” Relational database system to store, update, and manage all warehouse-related data.

LINQ â€” For efficient and readable data querying and manipulation within the application.

MVVM Design Pattern (Structure Only) â€” Applied for organizing the project layers (Models, Views, ViewModels) to improve maintainability and scalability.

Visual Studio 2022 â€” Main Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used for coding, designing forms, and managing the solution.
